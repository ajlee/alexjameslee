Back in December 2024 I saw an email from the British Sociology Association, offering £1000 for any PGRs who wanted to organise a regional conference. I thought, "OK why not?" It seemed like a good idea to meet other academics in and around Newcastle and thought it would help with my CV to say I'd organised a conference. 

So it happened on the 17th July 2025, and it was fab! I'm still kinda buzzing about it. And importantly… no technical disasters happened during the conference! Of course, the biggest pain was trying to deal with Northumbria University finance who couldn't tell us who was able to submit an invoice to the BSA. 

The people who made it happen - Jen, Petra, Beatriz, Sorcha, and last but not least, Ben, you are all stars. And lots of love to Divyali who helped get all this started. I feel like when I finally finish this PhD that I have maybe I have a crew, some cool buddies I can have a drink with when I submit or after my viva!

When I submitted the initial idea for the conference I wrote something about the Sociological Imagination having read it in an article somewhere, and it aligned with writing about social transformation and power. I read the original book, and it was interesting, but very vague in defining what the sociological imagination was. However, that was fine in this context, a vague definition would be more open and would make it easier for people to bring it into their presentations. 

On the day, I was really happy that, not only did every presentation talk about issues of power, most also brought in the idea of the social imagination too. The presentations ranged from late diagnoses of ADHD, SpaceX's destruction of indigenous sacred lands, and rural tourism in China and people's relationship with horses. And every presentation was genuinely super interesting. People made connections and hopefully these will be useful networks that PGRs will use to for research, their careers, and to make friends too.

We also had a film screening of 100 People, which was fascinating. It tells the story of Sheidfield, an area in Newcastle with a very strong community, told through the conversations of 100 different local people who interviewed each other. These ranged from people who still remembered details of the area from 70 years ago, to young children telling bad jokes and talking about the need for love in the community. But the film also raised many interesting questions. In these 100 interviews, how did they find the themes to pull out? The director ____ was on a panel with some members of the community at the end, and I believe someone asked in the Q&A and that it was a community process. At the pub afterwards, I asked the director about what they were doing with all the interviews, because it was only a ___ hour film and if there were 100 interviews then there was perhaps 50 - 100 hours of film. Apparently it is a community coding process, where members of the community will get together once a week to decide how to code and organise the data. Which sounds like some people's idea of a methodological nightmare but sounds fascinating to me!
